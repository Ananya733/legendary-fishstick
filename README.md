# Grocery Store Website
This is a flask web application which serves as an online shopping portal for a grocery store. In this application, a customer will be able to register, login, shop for products by adding them to a cart and then place the order. The application also allows for the registration and login of a store manager who can add, update and delete products and their categories.
All the files which make up the application are stored in the zip file "MAD-1.zip".
For this application to run it is required to install a python environment with flask and other necessary modules. 
The file MAD-1.zip consists of a root folder named "Project" which hosts a "Code" folder along with the Project Report. The Code folder consists of a file "README.txt" which specifies the required python modules and elaborates on how to start and run the application.
